# Essentials

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.2.

## Development server

Run `npm i` for node modules.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Design choices

For the icons, I chose to go with Angular material. 
Typically I would have created a formGroup with formControls to manage user input. The figma design for this task did not include Edit functionality, so neither did I.
